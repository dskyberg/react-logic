Play with logic gates

This app is built with React, Material-ui, and ReactFlow.  Just drag gates from
the Drawer onto the board, and connect them.  Switches provide a toggle to turn
them on and off.

## Truth Tables
You can view the truth tables that this app uses by clicking the button in the drawer.

## ReactFlow Attribution
I have turned off the attribution link on the ReactFlow Background, because I'm giving
attribution in this doc.  If you want to use this app for anything other than personal
use, then please respect the [ReactFlow Attribution request](https://reactflow.dev/docs/guides/remove-attribution/)

## Coming Soon
### Edge Styling for on vs off
Currently, edges are only black.  I want to fix to align with theming.  So, you can set
the color by setting a style tip on the edge data object.
